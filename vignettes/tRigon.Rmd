Pathomics enables automated, reproducible and precise histopathology analysis and morphological phenotyping. Similar to other molecular omics, pathomics datasets are highly-dimensional and large in size, but also face increased outlier variability and inherent data missingness, making a quick and comprehensible data analysis challenging. 

To facilitate pathomics data analysis and interpretation as well as support a broad implementation for all researchers we developed tRigon (Toolbox foR InteGrative pathOmics aNalysis), a Shiny application built in the R environment for fast, comprehensive and reproducible pathomics analysis. tRigon allows researchers without coding abilities to perform their own exploratory feature analyses.

## Installation

Users  need to have the R environment and optionally RStudio installed. You can download both [here](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/). 

Next you can run the following code to install tRigon.

```{r eval = FALSE}
install.packages('tRigon')
```

## Usage

Once the tRigon package is installed. You can run the following code to start the web app.

```{r eval = FALSE}
library(tRigon)
tRigon::run_tRigon()
```

| **Data** |                                                              |                                                                                                               |
|              | Processing data                                             | tRigon can process .csv files of pathomics data together with provided experiment / clinical data meta files. tRigon aggregates pathomics files and assigns them to the provided labels from the metadata. Users can choose between processing human or animal experiment data with calculations on specimen or single-structure level. |

Users can also specify a group and subgroup for specific correlation analysis. |
|              | Machine learning                                              | For calculation of feature importance tRigon supports random forests and recursive feature elimination (RFE) for classification and regression of chosen features based on a selected dependent variable. For RFE users can also specify the number of folds for cross-validation as well as repeats. |

## Data Preparation

tRigon supports .xlsx and .csv formats as data inputs for processing pathomics files or loading own datasets.

**Note that**: For processing pathomics files users need the raw data including a meta data file in .xlsx format containing additional information. For human and/or animal experiment data there are different conditions on how the meta data has to be organized. These can be found in the **Help** section of the application.

## Demo Data

FLASH-generated pathomics demo files for five human and mouse datasets as well as three non-pathomics medical datasets have been provided. Please use this [link to access](https://git-ce.rwth-aachen.de/labooratory-ai/flash/-/blob/main/NGM_DataRepository.zip) the demo data.
