# Welcome to tRigon &nbsp;<img src='tRigon_logo.png' align="right" height="200"/>

<b><span style="color:#F17F42">tRigon</span></b> stands for <b><span style="color:#F17F42">toolbox for integrative pathomics analysis</span></b> and provides users with flexible and efficient ways to evaluate and explore (path-) omics datasets. tRigon is built to be compatible with the framework for large-scale histomorphometry (FLASH) environment, but not limited to it.

tRigon offers several key features: 
  
(1) processing, aggregating and merging of pathomics files with clinical / experiment metadata for aggregation of highly-dimensional data frames.

(2) evaluating the generated pathomics data using descriptive statistics, multiple types of plots, statistical tests, k-means clustering, feature importance algorithms and correlation analysis.

(3) options for downloading plots, generated data, statistical outputs, as well as experiment reports for each analysis step for reproducibility.
